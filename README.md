## Marking Problems as Done

To mark a problem as complete, add "✅" under the **Status** column. You can also add any notes on approaches or key learnings in this README for future reference.

## Adding New Problems

To add more problems, simply add a new row to the table following the format above, with the problem name and initial status.

## Future Goals

- Aim to complete a set number of problems each week.
- Experiment with different algorithms and approaches to tackle various problem types.
- Document any key findings or efficient strategies in this README for reference.
